      <h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2>
Globally, more than ⅓ of food is wasted - and that’s bad news for our planet. Food waste is responsible for 10% of greenhouse gases, and we use a landmass the size of China to produce food we end up throwing away. It makes no sense, does it?

At Too Good To Go, we’re determined to help fix the problem. Our app lets you rescue delicious, unsold food from businesses to save it from being thrown away.

In turn, the app powers our efforts to build an anti-food waste movement. Globally, our dedicated team works within organizations like local governments and schools to shake up the food system, and change the way we think about food.</div>
